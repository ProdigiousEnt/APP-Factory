### 4. ✅ UPDATED: Guideline 2.3.6 - Age Rating

**Previous Issue:** App rated 4+ but can generate mature artistic content

**Resolution:**
- **Updated Age Rating to 17+**
- Selected "Frequent/Intense" for Sexual Content or Nudity category
- This aligns with industry standards (Midjourney iOS app is also 17+)

**Rationale:**
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash has built-in safety filters that block explicit nudity and harmful content
- However, artistic/suggestive content may be generated based on user prompts
- The app does NOT actively promote mature content generation
- 17+ rating allows creative freedom while maintaining appropriate content boundaries

## Content Safety Measures

### AI Safety Filters
VibePaper uses **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**, which includes:

### What the AI Allows:
- Artistic/abstract content
- Fashion and aesthetic imagery
- Suggestive but non-explicit artistic themes

### What the AI Blocks:

- Child safety violations
- Hate speech and graphic violence
- Illegal content
