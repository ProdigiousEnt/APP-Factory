    <h1>Privacy Policy for CityScope AI</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 10, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>CityScope AI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal data to provide and improve our service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device ID</strong>: An anonymous identifier used solely for subscription management through RevenueCat.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you use the app, such as tour generation count, to enforce free tier limits and improve app functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: GPS coordinates to generate location-specific AI tour guides (processed in real-time, not stored permanently).</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Generated Content</strong>: Tour guides and postcards you create are stored locally on your device only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Managing your subscription status</li>
        <li>Enforcing daily generation limits for free tier users</li>
        <li>Processing location data with AI to create personalized tour guides</li>
        <li>Generating AI postcards based on your location</li>
        <li>Improving app performance and user experience</li>
        <li>Providing customer support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption. We use Supabase for data storage and RevenueCat for subscription management. All data is anonymous and not linked to your personal identity. Generated content (tours and postcards) is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong>: For subscription management</li>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong>: For usage tracking and data storage</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong>: For AI tour guide and postcard generation (your location data is processed but not stored)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Generated Content</h2>
    <p>All tour guides and postcards you create using CityScope AI belong to you. We do not store, share, or use your generated content for any purpose other than displaying them to you within the app. Content is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain usage data for 90 days. Subscription data is managed by RevenueCat according to their retention policies. Location data is processed in real-time and not permanently stored. Generated content remains on your device until you delete it.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
        <li>Access the data we have collected</li>
        <li>Opt out of data collection (note: this may limit app functionality)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
