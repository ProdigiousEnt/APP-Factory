Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding SocialGenie Pro (Submission ID: d849fbd4-b898-4b08-8e91-812371f18f18).

We appreciate you identifying the issue with our subscription feature visibility under Guideline 2.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata. We have carefully reviewed your feedback and have made the following improvements to our app:

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Enhanced Subscription Visibility
   - Added a prominent "Upgrade to Pro" banner above the main content input area
   - The banner is now visible to all free-tier users at all times
   - Clear value proposition displayed: "Upgrade to Pro for Unlimited Generations"

2. Improved Usage Counter Display
   - Free tier usage counter (X/3) is prominently displayed in the app header
   - Users can clearly see their remaining generations before hitting the limit
   - "PRO" badge is visible in the header for easy access to subscription details

3. Professional UI Updates
   - Removed all test/placeholder language
   - Polished subscription flow with clear pricing and benefits
   - Professional paywall UI that clearly communicates Pro features

4. Testing Notes for Reviewers
   - We have included detailed testing instructions in the "Notes" section
   - Usage limits are temporarily disabled to allow thorough testing
   - Limits will be re-enabled immediately after approval

We believe these changes fully address the concerns raised in your review and provide a clear, accessible path for users to discover and subscribe to our Pro features.

The updated build is ready for resubmission. Please let us know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
